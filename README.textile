h1. Lua Haml

h2. About

Lua Haml is an in-progress implementation of the "Haml":http://haml-lang.com markup language for Lua.

At the moment, the only thing implemented is a buggy Haml lexer and some tests. It's a long way from being useful.

This is also my first "real" project in Lua, which I'm doing to learn more about both Lua and Ruby.

Therefore, it's *very* unlikely you will want to use this any time soon.

That being said, if you're interested, please check back in a few weeks, and feel free to offer your suggestions and withering criticism.
