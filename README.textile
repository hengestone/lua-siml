h1. Lua Haml

h2. About

Lua Haml is an in-progress implementation of the "Haml":http://haml-lang.com markup language for Lua.

At the moment, only a small subset of the Haml language works, but it's fairly close to being usable for simple template work.

To see what language features are currently supported, view the "currently support language" template in the spec directory.

h3. Immediate project goals

* Support the same Haml language as Ruby Haml with no unecessary changes. Lua Haml should just be Haml, with no embracing and extending.
* Add only minimal changes to make Haml more comfortable for Lua; i.e., "--" for comments rather than "#", and Lua tables as attributes.
* Include a cache for compiled templates.
* Help with and contribute to other Haml implementations.

h3. Potential goals

* Compile templates for other programming language. Ideally Lua Haml could be used in place of Ruby's Haml by using "Rufus-Lua":github.com/jmettraux/rufus-lua. The precompiler does only minimal code interpretation; far less than an editor like vim does. So this should very doable.

* Support source languages other than Haml. The lexer and precompiler are fairly well decoupled, so in theory it should be possible to create a lexer
for a different language that targets Lua Haml's precompiler. In practice this might not be worth doing - time will tell.

h2. Playing around with it

<pre>
<code>
-- see HTML output
./bin/luahaml test/samples/hello_world.haml

-- see lexer output
./bin/luahaml -l test/samples/hello_world.haml

-- see precompiler output
./bin/luahaml -p test/samples/hello_world.haml
</code>
</pre>

You can also install on your system via Luarocks by running "luarocks make" in the repository.

If you want to run the specs, you need to first install Luaspec, which you can
find at: "http://github.com/mirven/luaspec":http://github.com/mirven/luaspec.
