h1. Lua Haml

h2. About

Lua Haml is an in-progress implementation of the "Haml":http://haml-lang.com markup language for Lua.

At the moment, only a small subset of the Haml language works. It's a long way from completion, but I am currently working on it as my full time job, so expect rapid progress.

h3. Immediate project goals

* Support the same Haml language as Ruby Haml with no unecessary changes. Lua Haml should just be Haml, with no embracing and extending.
* Add only minimal changes to make Haml more comfortable for Lua; i.e., "--" for comments rather than "#", and Lua tables as attributes.
* Include a cache for compiled templates.
* Help with and contribute to other Haml implementations. 

h3. Potential goals

* Compile templates using any programming language. Ideally Lua Haml could potentially be used in place of Ruby's Haml by using "Rufus-Lua":github.com/jmettraux/rufus-lua.


To see what language features are supported, view the "hello world" file in test/samples/hello_world.haml.

h2. Playing around with it

Install Lua and Luarocks on your computer. If you're on a Mac, "here's a tutorial":http://blog.njclarke.com/posts/setting-up-g-for-web-development-on-os-x.

Install the "stdlib":http://luaforge.net/projects/stdlib/ rock (i.e., luarocks install stdlib).

Clone this repository.

Play with the provided script:

<pre>
<code>
-- see HTML output
./bin/luahaml test/samples/hello_world.haml

-- see lexer output
./bin/luahaml -l test/samples/hello_world.haml

-- see precompiler output
./bin/luahaml -p test/samples/hello_world.haml
</code>
</pre>

You can also install on your system via Luarocks by running "luarocks make" in the repository.
