# Lua Haml

## About

Lua Haml is an implementation of the [Haml](http://haml-lang.com) markup
language for Lua.

A Haml language reference can be found
[here](http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc/HAML_REFERENCE.md.html).

Lua Haml implements almost 100% of Ruby Haml, and attempts to be as compatible
as possible with it, with the following exceptions:

* Your script blocks are in Lua rather than Ruby, obviously.
* A few Ruby-specific filters are not implemented, namely `:maruku`, `:ruby` and `:sass`.
* No attribute methods. This feature would have to be added to Ruby-style
  attributes which are discouraged in Lua-Haml, or the creation of a
  Lua-specific attribute format, which I don't want to add.
* No object reference. This feature is idiomatic to the Rails framework and
  doesn't really apply to Lua.
* No ugly mode. Because of how Lua Haml is designed, there's no performance
  penalty for outputting indented code, so there's no reason to implement this
  option.

Here's a [Haml
template](http://github.com/norman/lua-haml/tree/master/sample.haml) that uses
most of Lua Haml's features.

## TODO

Lua Haml is now feature complete, but is still considered beta quality. That
said, I am using it for a production website, and will work quickly to fix any
bugs that are reported.  So please feel free to use it for serious work - just
not the Space Shuttle please.


## Getting it

The easiest way to install is via LuaRocks:

    luarocks install luahaml

You can also always install the latest master branch from Git via Luarocks too:

    luarocks install luahaml --from=http://luarocks.org/repositories/rocks-cvs

## Hacking it

The [Github repository](http://github.com/norman/lua-haml) is located at:

    git://github.com/norman/lua-haml.git

To run the specs, you should also install Telescope:

    luarocks install telescope

You can then run them using [Tlua](http://github.com/norman/tlua), or do

    tsc `find . -name '*_spec.lua'`

## Bug reports

Please report them on the [Github issue tracker](http://github.com/norman/lua-haml/issues).

## Thanks

To Hampton Caitlin, Nathan Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein for their work on the
original Haml. Thanks also to Daniele Alessandri for being LuaHaml's earliest
"real" user, and a source of constant encouragement.
